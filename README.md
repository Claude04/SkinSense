## 📍 Project Roadmap

This project follows a structured development process with 3 sprints: setup, development, and presentation.

Work includes: forking and cloning the [`radiant`](https://github.com/trnle/radiant) repository into the `ksu-hmi` GitHub organization, evaluating the cloned code, setting up project directories (`routines`, `ingredients`, `images`), and developing a basic Streamlit interface for skincare routine tracking. Additional tasks include researching the [`skincare-routine-helper`](https://github.com/florating/skincare-routine-helper) repo for more ideas.
